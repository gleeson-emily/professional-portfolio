# Professional Portfolio - BootCamp Assignment 2

This is a mockup of what my professional web development portfolio will look like. The site was built using HTML and CSS, and features semantic elements in the HTML, and a responsive design for viewing on smaller screens.

Note that I have only finished one project at the moment, so the other four project slots feature placeholder images and links to empty practice repositories built during class. These will be updated as I complete other projects. Additionally, I will provide links to my actual LinkedIn page when I get the chance to update it - I confirmed with my instructor that providing the actual link to my page wouldn't be necessary at this point in time.

I tried to consolidate my CSS to be under 300 lines, but this wasn't possible. Additionally, I spent a good two hours trying to centre the image in the project-1 class, and I just cannot get it to properly display when the window is over 992 pixels. Any feedback and advice on fixing this/consolidating the code will be much appreciated.
